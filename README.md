## How to use FF84™
FF84 is a simple to understand program user side; to begin the search through the database a user simply must use either of the 
*New Case* links \(Pictured Below\)

THIS IS WHERE THE FIRST SCREENSHOT GOES

Then the user must input the image of the criminal for comparison \(pictured below\)against the database, the program will then 
output whether or not there was a match as well as the times and locations that the suspect was detected.
